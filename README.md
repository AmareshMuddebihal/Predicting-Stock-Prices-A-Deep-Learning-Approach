# Stock Price Forecasting Using LSTM and GRU

This project explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models for stock price forecasting# # .We compare the performance of these deep learning architectures in predicting market trends using historical stock price data# .

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage LSTM and GRU neural networks to analyze financial time series data and forecast stock prices# # .By implementing these advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of LSTM and GRU models in predicting stock market movements# .
Stock price forecasting is crucial for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions# # .This project employs LSTM and GRU neural networks to analyze historical stock price data and make predictions# # .Through comparative analysis, we assess the performance and accuracy of these models in capturing market dynamics# .
